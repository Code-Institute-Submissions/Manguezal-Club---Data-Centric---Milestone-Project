                The Mangrove ("Manguezal" in portuguese) is a transition ecosystem between terrestrial and marine environments, famous for its muddy character 
                and plants with exposed and crooked roots. Due to its aspect, the importance of its biodiversity has been ignored 
                for years and cities like Recife have not thought twice about grounding their mangroves to build houses and buildings 
                over the years. Over time, this perspective has changed and today mangroves are protected by law and even serve as 
                inspiration for cultural movements, such as the Mangue Beat headed by the late Chico Science. 
                This ecosystem also served as inspiration for a brewery in Pernambuco (Brazil), Manguezal.<br/>
                            
            <br/>
                In mid-2014, partners Gabriel Suassuna, Lucas Sampaio, Roberto Moretti and Eduardo Antunes were producing beer in Olinda, 
                located in Greater Recife, for their own consumption and were already thinking of a name that had something to do with the 
                region's culture. They organized meetings with friends in a house located in the Apipucos neighborhood (quite surrounded by 
                mangroves), in Recife, to drink homemade beer, eat good food and make small talk. In the meantime, the idea of ​​naming the brewery
                Manguezal came up, and the first labels, still in the home phase, started to give the beers a face. The styles have always been 
                well accepted by the crowd and that's when they decided, in 2017, to
                make the brand official and produce in a gypsy way at the Capunga brewery.</p>
